## Data Files:

Some of the Jupyter notebooks for this chapter have external data files that should be stored in the same
folder as the notebooks.  In all cases the individual notebooks describe the contents of the data files, 
and all data files have explanatory comment headers.

### Figure 10.1
Distributions of diffuse and warm-hot intergalactic gas from [Martizzi et al. 2019, MNRAS, 486, 3766](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.486.3766M),
using a color full-resolution of the original Figure 8 from that paper provided by Davide Martizzi. For the book we selected two panels from the uppr right 
and converted them to grayscale.
