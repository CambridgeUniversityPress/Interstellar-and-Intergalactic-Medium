# CIE Cooling Functions

Pre-calculated collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) cooling functions for a range of abundances from 0.001 to 5x solar.

Calculations were performed using [ChiantiPy](https://github.com/chianti-atomic/ChiantiPy/) v0.9.5 and the
[CHIANTI atomic database](https://www.chiantidatabase.org/). This computation is very time-consuming (about
2 hours per metallicity), so we provide these ASCII text files with the results for plotting.

Files have names <kbd>cooling_z##.txt</kbd>, where ## is the abundance relative to solar, from 0.001 solar to 5x solar.
