### Images
The grayscale image in Figure 6.1 was scanned by the authors from the plate in an original bound
edition of the 1899 *Astrophysical Journal*, Volume 9.

## Data Files:

The Jupyter notebooks above have accompanying data files that should be stored 
in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks.

### Figure 6.2
Data for luminosity and angular-diameter distances for 100 open star clusters from 
[Trumpler, R. 1930, Lick Observatory Bulletin #420, 14, 154](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1930LicOB..14..154T), Table 3.  See the 
Jupyter notebook for what data were used. 
 * **Trumpler_GoodData.txt** - good open cluster distances, 2-column ASCII text
 * **Trumpler_BadData.text** - less-certain open cluster distances, 2-column ASCII text

### Figure 6.4
Data from [Green 2008, Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 92, 1305](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024808002158), Table 1, intrinsic silicon at 300K.
 * **Green2008_Si300K.txt** - wavelength-dependent real and imaginary index of refraction, 4-column ASCII text.
