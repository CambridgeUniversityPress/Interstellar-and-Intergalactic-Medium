Figures 1.10-1.12 are all related and computed in one combined notebook named Fig1_FGH.ipynb.

## Large Data Files

Data sets for Figures 1.3 and 1.9 are too large for GitHub, so we provide links to the online sources here.  The data files need to be
stored in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and uncompressed.

### Figure 1.3 - Pleiades star cluster
 * DSS2 red plate image of the Pleiades in FITS format from the [ESO Online Digital Sky Survey](https://archive.eso.org/dss/dss)
 * Coordinates: RA=03:4.6, Dec=+24:06.2
 * Search Field: 90x65 arcminutes
 
### Figure 1.9 - All-Sky H-alpha Emission Map
 * [Composite all-sky H-alpha (Finkbeiner) map in FITS HEALPix format](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/foreground/fg_halpha_map.cfm) at the NASA GSFC [LAMBDA](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov) database.
 
## Images
The grayscale images in Figures 1.4 through 1.8 were derived from original color images.

(Plate X, Figure 5 of Huggins 1864, Phil. Trans. R. Soc., 154, 437), scanned by the authors and included
in this repository.
