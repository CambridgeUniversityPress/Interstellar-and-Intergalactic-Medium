# Chapter 1: Introduction

Jupyter notebooks for author-generated figures in Ryden & Pogge, *Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium*, Chapter 1.

## Contents:
<dl>
  <dd>Figure 1.1 - Approximate division of the baryonic mass density of the current
universe.
  <dd>Figure 1.3 - Negative image of the Pleiades cluster (DSS2 image processing)
  <dd>Figure 1.9 - All-sky map of H-alpha emission (LAMBDA HEALPix map processing)
  <dd>Figure 1.10 - Field, Goldsmith, & Habing (FGH) cooling function in the cooler ISM
  <dd>Figure 1.11 - FGH equilibrium density curve for which the ISM temperature remains constant.
  <dd>Figure 1.12 - FGH multi-phase ISM isobaric thermal stability diagram (P vs. n)
</dl>
Figures 1.10-1.12 are all related and computed in one combined notebook named Fig1_FGH.ipynb.

We omit images derived from the literature or public domain: Figures 1.2, and 1.4-1.8, but links to the originals may be found
in the *Bibliography and Figure Credits* section at the end of the book.

## Required Data:

Data sets for Figures 1.3 and 1.9 are too large for GitHub, so we provide links to the online sources here.  The data files need to be
stored in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and uncompressed.

### Figure 1.3 - Pleiades star cluster
 * DSS2 red plate image of the Pleiades in FITS format from the [ESO Online Digital Sky Survey](https://archive.eso.org/dss/dss)
 * Coordinates: RA=03:4.6, Dec=+24:06.2
 * Search Field: 90x65 arcminutes
 
### Figure 1.9 - All-Sky H-alpha Emission Map
 * [Composite all-sky H-alpha (Finkbeiner) map in FITS HEALPix format](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/foreground/fg_halpha_map.cfm) at the NASA GSFC [LAMBDA](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov) database.
