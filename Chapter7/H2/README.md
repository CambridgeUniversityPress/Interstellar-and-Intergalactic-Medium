# Molecular Hydrogen electronic states

Copies of the moleular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) potential curves and vibrational energy levels tabulated by
[Sharp, 1971, Atomic Data, 2, 119](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971AD......2..119S), used by figures
for chapter 7 of Ryden and Pogge *Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium*.

This folder should reside in the same folder as the Jupyter notebooks for Chapter 7 figures.

## Contents:

We provide copies of the data for the ground state and first two excited electronic states
of H<sub>2</sub>:
 * $^{1}\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ ground state
 * $^{1}\Sigma_{u}^{+}$ first electronic state (Lyman bands)
 * $^{1}\Pi_{u}^{+}$ second electronic state (Werner bands)
 
For each level, there are two files:

Potential curve: _potl.dat:
 * interproton distance, r, in Angstroms
 * potential energy, V(r), in eV
 
Vibrational levels: _v.dat:
 * v = vibrational quantum number
 * eV = energy in eV
 * Rmin = minimum inter-proton distance in Angstroms
 * Rmax = maximum inter-proton distance in Angstroms
