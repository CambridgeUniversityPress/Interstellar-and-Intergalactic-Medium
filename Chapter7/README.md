# Chapter 7: Molecular Clouds

Figures from Chapter 7 of Ryden & Pogge, *Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium*.

## Contents:

### Jupyter Notebooks:
<dl>
<dd>Figure X.1 - computed or data-driven figure.
</dl>

## Data Files:

Figures X.n and X.m have accompanying data files that should be kept 
in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks.

### Figure X.n
* HoII_MODS1_Spec.txt: Holmberg II HII region spectrum, 2-column ASCII text

Data sets for Figures X.y and X.z are too large for GitHub, so we provide links to the online sources here.  The data files need to be
stored in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and uncompressed.

### Figure X.z - All-Sky H-alpha Emission Map
* [Composite all-sky H-alpha (Finkbeiner) map in FITS HEALPix format](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/foreground/fg_halpha_map.cfm) at the NASA GSFC [LAMBDA](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov) database.
