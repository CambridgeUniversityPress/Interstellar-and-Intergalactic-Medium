# Chapter 4: Warm Ionized Medium and Ionized Nebulae

Figures from Chapter 4 of Ryden & Pogge, *Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium*.

## Contents:

### Jupyter Notebooks:
<dl>
<dd>Figure 4.1 - Photoionization cross-sections of H and He
<dd>Figure 4.2 - Radius of a Stromgren sphere
<dd>Figure 4.4 - Thermal Equilibrium for a model HII region
<dd>Figure 4.5 - HII region spectrum in the Whirlpool Galaxy
<dd>Figure 4.8 - electron density diagnostic diagram
<dd>Figure 4.10 - R and D ionization fronts
</dl>
All other figures are original artwork included in the book slide set.

## Data Files:

Figures 4.4 and 4.5 have accompanying data files that should be kept 
in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks.

### Figure 4.4
* **HII_40K_cool.txt**: Cloudy model calculation of heating and cooling in an HII region around a 40,000K star. 3-column ASCII text format.

### Figure 4.5
 * **m51_mods1.txt**: Optical spectrum of an HII region in the Whirlpool Galaxy from [Croxall et al. 2014, ApJ, 808, 42](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...808...42C). 3-column ASCII text format.

## Python Notes

The notebook for Figure 4.8 uses PyNeb ([Luridiana, Morisset, & Shaw 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...573A..42L/abstract)), which must be installed
before you can run the notebook.
