# Chapter 4: Warm Ionized Medium and Ionized Nebulae

Figures from Chapter 4 of Ryden & Pogge, *Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium*.

## Jupyter Notebooks:

<dd>Figure 4.1 - Photoionization cross-sections of H and He
<dd>Figure 4.2 - Radius of a Stromgren sphere
<dd>Figure 4.4 - Thermal Equilibrium for a model HII region
<dd>Figure 4.5 - HII region spectrum in the Whirlpool Galaxy

All other figures are original artwork included in the book slide set.

## Data Files:

Some of the Jupyter notebooks for this chapter have external data files that should be stored in the same
folder as the notebooks.  In all cases the individual notebooks describe the contents of the data files, 
and all data files have explanatory comment headers.

### Figure 4.4
* **HII_40K_cool.txt**: Cloudy model calculation of heating and cooling in an HII region around a 40,000K star. 3-column ASCII text format.

### Figure 4.5
 * **m51_mods1.txt**: Optical spectrum of an HII region in the Whirlpool Galaxy from [Croxall et al. 2014, ApJ, 808, 42](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...808...42C). 3-column ASCII text format.

## Python Notes

The notebook for Figure 4.8 uses PyNeb ([Luridiana, Morisset, & Shaw 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...573A..42L/abstract)), which must be installed
before you can run the notebook.
