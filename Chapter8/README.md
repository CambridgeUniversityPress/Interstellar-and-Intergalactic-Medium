## Data Files:

Some of the Jupyter notebooks for this chapter have external data files that should be stored in the same
folder as the notebooks.  In all cases the individual notebooks describe the contents of the data files, 
and all data files have explanatory comment headers.

Data set for Figures 8.1 is too large for GitHub, so we provide links to the online source here.  The data files need to be
stored in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and uncompressed.
