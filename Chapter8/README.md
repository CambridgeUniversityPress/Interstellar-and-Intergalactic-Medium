## Data Files:

Some of the Jupyter notebooks for this chapter have external data files that should be stored in the same
folder as the notebooks.  In all cases the individual notebooks describe the contents of the data files, 
and all data files have explanatory comment headers.

### Figure 8.2
XMM-Newton RGS X-ray spectrum of the Milky Way circumgalactic medium in absorption towards the quasar 1ES1553+113 from
[Das et al. 2019, ApJL, 882, L23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882L..23D), Figure 2, data provided by
Sanskriti Das, Ohio State University, Department of Astronomy.
* **Das2019_RGS1.txt** - XMM-Newton RGS1 X-ray spectrum: 8-column ASCII text.
* **Das2019_RGS2.txt** - XMM-Newton RGS2 X-ray spectrum: 8-column ASCII text.

### Figure 8.3
XMM-Newton X-ray emission spectra of the Milky Way circumgalactic Medium from [Das et al. 2019, ApJ, 887, 257](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...887..257D
Figure 2a, provided by Sanskriti Das.  These are all in the CGM/ folder that accompanies this notebook. The data are all multi-column ASCII text format,
organized by data set. There are 10 data sets in all that contribute as described in Das et al. 2019. 
* **CGMdata.tgz** - gzipped tar file with the CGM data sets.  Unpacks into the **CGM/** folder with all its subfolders and files. [287Kb]

### Figure 8.6
Original data was provided to the authors by Fabio Gastaldello, INAF-ISAF Milan
* **Coma_NuSTAR_spectrum.txt** - NuSTAR X-ray spectrum of the Coma Cluster core from [Gastaldello, et al. 2015, ApJ, 800, 139](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...800..139G/), Figure 3: 5-column ASCII text

## External Data
The data set for Figure 8.1 is too large for GitHub, so we provide a link to the online source here.  The data file need to be
stored in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and uncompressed.

### Figure 8.1
Version of the [Westmeier 2018, MNRAS, 474, 289](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.474..289W) HI4PI Survey HVC HI column density map from Tobias Westmeier:
* [An all-sky map of high-velocity clouds](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Tobias.Westmeier/research_hvcsky.php#download) FITS format in Cartesian coordinates,
(8Mb compressed, 37Mb uncompressed)

## Images
The grayscale images in Figures 8.4 and 8.5 were derived from original color images:

### Figure 8.4 - M82
Images of starburst galaxy M82 from the Spitzer and Chandra space telescopes.
  * M82 in the infrared taken with the Spitzer Space Telescope: [Spitzer sig14-004a](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/5743-sig14-004a-The-Cigar-Galaxy-M82)
  * M82 in X-rays taken with the Chandra X-ray Observatory: [Chandra 2011 M82](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2011/m82/)

### Figure 8.5 - Coma Cluster
Images of the Coma Cluster of galaxies in visible light (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and X-rays (Chandra X-ray Observatory).
