# Chapter 8: Circumgalactic and Intergalactic Gas

Figures from Chapter 8 of Ryden & Pogge, *Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium*.

## Jupyter Notebooks:

<dd>Figure 8.1 - All-sky map of HI column density for Milky Way high-velocity clouds
<dd>Figure 8.2 - XMM-Newton X-ray spectrum of the quasar 1ES 1553+113
<dd>Figure 8.3 - XMM-Newton X-ray spectrum looking through our galaxy’s CGM
<dd>Figure 8.6 - NuSTAR spectrum of the central 12 × 12 arcmin region of the Coma Cluster

## Data Files:

Some of the Jupyter notebooks for this chapter have external data files that should be stored in the same
folder as the notebooks.  In all cases the individual notebooks describe the contents of the data files, 
and all data files have explanatory comment headers.

### Figure 8.6
Original data was provided to the authors by Fabio Gastaldello, INAF-ISAF Milan
* **Coma_NuSTAR_spectrum.txt** - NuSTAR X-ray spectrum of the Coma Cluster core from [Gastaldello, et al. 2015, ApJ, 800, 139](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...800..139G/), Figure 3: 5-column ASCII text

Data set for Figures 8.1 is too large for GitHub, so we provide links to the online source here.  The data files need to be
stored in the same folder as the corresponding Jupyter notebooks and uncompressed.

Version of the [Westmeier 2018, MNRAS, 474, 289](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.474..289W) HI4PI HVC HI column density map from Tobias Westmeier:

## Images
The grayscale images in Figures 8.4 and 8.5 were derived from original color images:

### Figure 8.4 - M82
Images of starburst galaxy M82 from the Spitzer and Chandra space telescopes.
